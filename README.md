# Usage
- Clone Repo
- In 'src/', either edit existing code file or create a new code file with the extension .wd 
- Open terminal in root directory
- IF ON MAC
    - Open './run' in text editor and confirm your script name is in the run script
    - In the terminal: execute './run'
- IF ON WINDOWS
    - Open './run.bat' in text editor and confirm your script name is in the run script
    - In the terminal: execute './run.bat'
            
Please note that you can use directories when running the interpreter agaisnt your file! The script name will tell the interpreter to look for an entry() method in that file but you do not need to include the name of other files in your project as long as they don't contain an entry of their own.

INFO!
- This will install python on your system. I thought about making it a bundled download but instead opted to do a script install before your run a file in wdscript. Unfortunately python is a pre-requisite for this! 

Thanks everyone :)
